    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

    "A housing development is planned for an unincorporated piece of property between Naperville and Lisle.  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.531  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** This idiom was interpreted literally. TF-IDF focuses on “piece” and “cake” as individual tokens — completely missing the **figurative meaning** (\"easy task\"). No result even comes close to the intended phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query:** didn't hate it  \n",
    "- **Top similar sentence:**  \n",
    "A daring nine-year-old boy who asked “why do people hate you?”  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.488  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** TF-IDF picks up on the word “hate” but completely ignores the **negation** (“didn’t”). The results are all about hate crimes, strong opinions, or emotional anger — opposite to the intended neutral/slightly positive sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query:** storm of lies  \n",
    "- **Top similar sentence:**  \n",
    "But Johnson confronted Livingstone in a lift after the show and shouted: “It’s all f***ing lies, it’s all f***ing lies”.  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.613  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** TF-IDF sort of works here — it captures the word “lies” — but the phrase “storm of lies” is metaphorical. Results about **weather storms**, **dust storms**, and **technical analysis** show how TF-IDF can’t distinguish metaphor from literal language.\n",

    "Lloy Ball returned home to the city of Woodburn as an Olympic volleyball champion.  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.377  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** Works as intended. TF-IDF handles specific named entities like “Olympic” well, especially in a sports context. Multiple top results refer to Olympic athletes or events.\n",

    "2. **Query:** terrorist attack president  \n",

    "Clinton told reporters Friday at the State Department that, quote, “what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.”  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.487  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** This is a solid match. The sentence is relevant and includes “terrorist attack” and references a high-level government figure. TF-IDF does well when literal terms are used in high-density news contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query:** fed up  \n",

    "Fed fund futures continue to favour the status quo on Monday and price in a hold on rates until the end of the year.  \n",
    "- **Similarity:** 0.429  \n",
    "- **Explanation:** The first result is a classic **TF-IDF failure** — interpreting “fed” as the **Federal Reserve** instead of as part of theliteral phrase “fed up” However, later matches correctly captured “fed up” in emotional contexts. TF-IDF recovers a bit thanks to literal term matches.\n",

    "- High similarity scores due to repetition of the word “Fox”.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF:**\n",
    "- Same results, but scores are slightly more distinct.\n",
    "- TF-IDF works similarly here because “Fox” is rare and repeated in relevant contexts.\n",

    " **Conclusion:** Both perform well. No added value from TF-IDF here, but still consistent.\n",

    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF:**\n",
    "- Exact same results and order as BoW.\n",

    "\n",
    "**BoW:**\n",
    "- Only the word “dog” has good matches — several articles about dog attacks or rescues.\n",
    "- “Fox” and “quick/lazy” are ignored due to lack of presence in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF:**\n",
    "- Similar behavior: many top results are about dogs, some have both “dog” and “fox”.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Conclusion:** Neither model captures sentence semantics, but TF-IDF slightly edges out by rewarding shared rarer words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Query: `Fed`\n",
    "\n",
    "**BoW:**\n",

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."

    "(10p) Complete the function below that takes as input the sentence in the form of tokens (so it's a list of words) and calculates the sentence embedding vector. First, we would need to retrieve the word embeddings for each word from our loaded model and then average the vectors.\n",
